		<P>Kankali Secondary School has its own hostel facility.Hostel life is a free life. In a hostel, a student is free from the cares and worries of everyday. He can concentrate fully on his studies. In a hostel, a student mixes up with different types of students. He becomes well-mannered and cultured. He learns how to behave in society. He acquires good virtues and becomes a good citizen. He is able to increase his knowledge and remove his weaknesses. He interacts with other students and is no shyer. He learns to speak fluently and confidently. One should avoid bad company in a hostel. Hostel life is a memorable period of oneâ€™s whole life.
